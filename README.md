# We-Wingit

## Description:

We-Wingit is a dummy project. It is a chatbot, that uses a customer service data, and acts as a chatbot where clients of We-Wingit can talk to the chatbot if they encounter any problems, or want to ask any questions.

## Reason:

The project is a dummy project, used to apply the knowledge I have learnt about Open AI API, more specifically, using a dataset to make a trained module based on it.
